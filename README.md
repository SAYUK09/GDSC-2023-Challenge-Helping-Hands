- Ask users to list the issues they're facing in their area.
- Call for a vote to prioritize the problems based on the number of votes.
- Raise funds for the problem that receives the highest number of votes.

- Refund the amount back to donors if there are no results after some time.
- Move on to address another persistent problem.

### Steps to run the app:
